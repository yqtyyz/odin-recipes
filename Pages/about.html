    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Born and raised in Toronto, ON, I completed a french immersion certificate before attending the University of Waterloo to complete my undergraduate studies. 
        During this period, I completed a year long exchange in France where I attended the Universite Lyon 2. 
        I inevitably graduated with a joint honours degree in Environment and Resource Studies and Economics.

        Soon after completing my undergraduate degree, I moved back to Toronto and began working in financial services as a bilingual client relations representative Invesco Canada.
